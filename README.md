nfl-tweets
==========
This is just a little side project that uses Python and Tweepy to drink from the Twitter fire hose.  It gets all tweets meeting the search criteria, saves the tweet's text, looks for coordinates, and stores them if they're there.  There is also an R script (nfl_plot_r.R) that includes creation of a map in the USA.
